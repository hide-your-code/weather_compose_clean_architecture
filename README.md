# Weapose - Weather ❤️ Compose

This is an example for show current weather from any location. The **Weapose** is builted by Android Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.

## :ok_woman: Firstly

This app is inspired by:

- **[Weather app](https://github.com/bachhoan88/MAD-Clean-Architecture) - [bachhoan88](https://github.com/bachhoan88): for solutions and architectures.**
- **[Weather](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/weather-kit) - [Jagan](https://www.uplabs.com/jaganbv): for beautiful design.**

I want to say thanks for those people to help me to make this app.

## :construction: In progress

I'm trying to implement **Version Catalog** for new Gradle's version but the **Dependabot** doesn't support it ([seeing this](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/6249)). 

You can check out from `v1.0.4/version_catalog` to see what I done.

## :tada: Ready on Google Play

Now, you can download it on Google Play Store. Install it and give me your feedback!

## :hammer: How to build app

- Using the newest version of Android Studio Canary.
- You must add `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY` and `MAPS_API_KEY` inside `local.properties` to build and run Weapose app, like the code below:

    ```kotlin
    BASE_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/
    API_KEY=API_KEY // Fill your open weather api key in here
    MAPS_API_KEY=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY // Fill your google maps api key in here
    ```

## :open_file_folder: Module

Weapose is built according to the Clean Architecture model combined with the MVVM design pattern. To learn more, refer to the links below.

- Guild to app architecture by Google Android.
- Clean architectur by Uncle Bob.

## :mag_right: Unit test

- Using [MockK](https://mockk.io/) to write unit test.
- Using [Kotlin Reflection](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reflection.html) to access the private method, private property, etc.
- Using [Kotlin Kover](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover) to generate the test coverage. To generate, you just run command ` ./gradlew koverHtmlReport`.

## :tram: Data flow

Weapose is supported by `Flow` and `suspend` for data stream flow in app.

## :x: Error flow

In data module, when data is returned error, I will transform the error to `ResponseException`. And then in domain and presentation, I transform the error from `ResponseException` to `WeatherException` to show the error to UI.
